# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew a Data Analyst that has spent the last 10+ years working in Workforce Management, where I focused 
on using data to improve staffing and operations. Over time, I realized I really enjoy digging into data and finding 
ways to make smarter business decisions, so I recently made the jump into data analytics and completed a bootcamp to 
level up my skills in Python, SQL, and Tableau. Now Iâ€™m looking to combine my hands-on WFM experience with analytics 
to help teams work more efficiently and make better decisions. Iâ€™m based in Indianapolis and open to remote, hybrid, 
or on-site roles.
