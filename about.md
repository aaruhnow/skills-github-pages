# About Me

Hi, I’m Andrew — a Data Analyst that has spent the last 10+ years working in Workforce Management, where I focused on using data to improve staffing and operations. Over time, I realized I really enjoy digging into data and finding ways to make smarter business decisions, so I recently made the jump into data analytics and completed a bootcamp to level up my skills in Python, SQL, and Tableau. Now I’m looking to combine my hands-on WFM experience with analytics to help teams work more efficiently and make better decisions. I’m based in Indianapolis and open to remote, hybrid, or on-site roles.
