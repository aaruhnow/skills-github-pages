# Projects

Here are a few of the data projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

## Citi Bike Strategy Dashboard  
Analyzed NYC bike usage and weather trends to identify availability gaps and optimize bike distribution across stations. Used geospatial mapping to highlight underperforming locations and propose operational improvements.  

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Plotly, Kepler.gl, Streamlit
